**Richard Buckminster Fuller** (July 12, 1895 – July 1, 1983) was an American [architect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect "Architect"), [systems theorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theorist "Systems theorist"), author, designer, inventor and futurist. Fuller published more than 30 books, coining or popularizing terms such as "[Spaceship Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceship_Earth "Spaceship Earth")", "[Dymaxion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion "Dymaxion")" house/car, [ephemeralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeralization "Ephemeralization"), [synergetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Fuller) "Synergetics (Fuller)"), and "[tensegrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity "Tensegrity")". He also developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known [geodesic dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome "Geodesic dome"). Carbon molecules known as [fullerenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullerene "Fullerene") were later named by scientists for their structural and mathematical resemblance to geodesic spheres.

Fuller was the second World President of [Mensa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensa_International "Mensa International") from 1974 to 1983.

# Life and work

Fuller was born on July 12, 1895, in [Milton, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton,_Massachusetts "Milton, Massachusetts"), the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller and Caroline Wolcott Andrews, and grand-nephew of [Margaret Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Fuller "Margaret Fuller"), an American journalist, critic, and [women's rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights "Women's rights") advocate associated with the American [transcendentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism "Transcendentalism") movement. The unusual middle name, Buckminster, was an ancestral family name. As a child, Richard Buckminster Fuller tried numerous variations of his name. He used to sign his name differently each year in the guest register of his family summer vacation home at Bear Island, Maine. He finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller.

## Education

Fuller attended [Milton Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Academy "Milton Academy") in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at [Harvard College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College "Harvard College"), where he was affiliated with [Adams House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_House_(Harvard_University) "Adams House (Harvard University)"). He was expelled from Harvard twice: first for spending all his money partying with a [vaudeville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville "Vaudeville") troupe, and then, after having been readmitted, for his "irresponsibility and lack of interest". By his own appraisal, he was a non-conforming misfit in the fraternity environment.

## Depression and epiphany

Fuller said that he had experienced a profound incident which would provide direction and purpose for his life. He felt as though he was suspended several feet above the ground enclosed in a white sphere of light. A voice spoke directly to Fuller, and declared:

> From now on you need never await temporal attestation to your thought. You think the truth. You do not have the right to eliminate yourself. You do not belong to you. You belong to Universe. Your significance will remain forever obscure to you, but you may assume that you are fulfilling your role if you apply yourself to converting your experiences to the highest advantage of others.

Fuller stated that this experience led to a profound re-examination of his life. He ultimately chose to embark on "an experiment, to find what a single individual could contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity".
